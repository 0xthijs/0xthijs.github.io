# HR Strategist. Data Nerd.

I bridge the gap between "HR wants this" and "Computers can do this."

I am a Senior HR Business Partner who realized that 80% of HR work is repetitive data crunching. So I taught myself to code. Now, I build AI agents and analytics pipelines that automate the boredom away, leaving time for actual improvements.

### What I Bring to the Table

1.  **I speak "Business"**: I know what P&L, attrition cost, and headcount planning actually mean.
2.  **I speak "Code"**: Python, SQL, and increasingly, AI Agent architectures.
3.  **I ship**: I don't just make dashboards; I build tools. (See my [Projects](/projects))

### My Tech "Stack"
I don't care about the newest framework. I care about what solves the problem.

*   **Languages**: Python (Pandas/Playwright), SQL
*   **AI**: LLM Prompt Engineering, Agentic Workflows (Gemini/OpenAI)
*   **Web**: Hugo, basic HTML/JS/CSS (enough to be dangerous)

### Let's Talk
If you need someone who can translate business needs into technical requirements—or just build the thing themselves—let's chat.
