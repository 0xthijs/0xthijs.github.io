## What I Do

My work combines **People Operations** with **AI Engineering**. I develop tools that identify workforce risks proactively, providing data to support retention strategies.

**Recent results from my Data Lab:**
- Identified **64 employees** with elevated burnout risk factors.
- Analyzed promotion data, finding a higher attrition rate (**17%**) among recently promoted employees compared to peers (14%).
- Validated **< 2% pay gap** across all job levels in a full diversity audit
