# Thijs van der Aa

**Senior HRBP → AI-Augmented HR Product Owner**

> I reduce regrettable attrition by turning workforce data into automated, AI-powered decision tools — so CHROs act on evidence, not instinct.

## What I Do

I sit at the intersection of **People Operations** and **AI Engineering**. While most HRBPs rely on gut feel and exit interviews, I build tools that surface workforce risks *before* they become resignations.

**Recent results from my Data Lab:**
- Identified **64 employees** at 4x burnout risk using a composite scoring model
- Discovered the "Promotion Curse" — recently promoted talent leaves at **17%** vs 14% for stagnant peers
- Validated **< 2% pay gap** across all job levels in a full diversity audit

## What I'm Building Now

🔧 **[Job Intelligence](https://github.com/0xthijs/hr-ai-portfolio/tree/main/data-lab/job-intelligence)** — An AI agent that scrapes job boards, uses Gemini to classify listings by seniority and salary, and generates weekly intelligence reports. It's a proof-of-concept for how LLMs can automate repetitive HR operations.
