## The "Invisible Organization"

Traditional Org Charts tell you who **should** be talking. Network Analysis tells you who **is** talking.

This tool is designed for **HR Business Partners (HRBPs)** to diagnose strategic health using 4 key lenses:

1.  **🔍 Influence & Bottlenecks**: Identify key influencers who aren't managers. These are your culture carriers.
2.  **🚨 Flight Risk**: Overlay risk models onto the network. If a high-influence node (a "Hub") leaves, the network fractures.
3.  **🏠 Work Mode Integration**: Are your remote employees isolated? Visualize the "Distance Bias" in real-time.
4.  **🌱 Onboarding**: Are new hires gravitating to the center, or stuck on the periphery?
