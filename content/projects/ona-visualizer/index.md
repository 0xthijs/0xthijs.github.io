## 1. 💼 The Business Case: Why ONA Matters?

Traditional Org Charts are static lines of reporting. They show who **should** be talking.
**Organizational Network Analysis (ONA)** reveals who **is** talking. It maps the informal structure of the company.

As HR Business Partners, we often rely on intuition to answer critical questions. This tool turns that intuition into data.

### Strategic Lenses (View Modes)

This Proof of Concept (PoC) focuses on four specific strategic questions:

1.  **🔍 Network Strength ("Influence & Bottlenecks")**
    *   *Question:* Who are the people holding the team together?
    *   *Insight:* We calculate a **Network Strength (1-10)** score based on connection volume. This highlights "Hubs"—informal leaders who bridge gaps. If they leave, the network fractures.

2.  **🚨 Retention Risk ("Proactive Retention")**
    *   *Question:* What happens if our high-risk employees leave?
    *   *Insight:* The tool calculates a **Retention Risk (1-10)** score combining role criticality and tenure. It highlights **Critical Points of Failure**—high-influence nodes that are at risk of turnover.

3.  **🏠 Work Mode Integration ("Hybrid Culture")**
    *   *Question:* Is "Hybrid" working, or are we creating two separate companies?
    *   *Insight:* By visualizing Remote (Purple) vs. In-Office (Green) employees, we can spot "Proximity Bias"—where office workers only talk to office workers, isolating remote talent.

4.  **⚡ Productivity Dynamics ("Output vs. Network")**
    *   *Question:* Does being more connected mean being more productive?
    *   *Insight:* We track a **Productivity Score (1-10)** (simulated from Jira/Git) to correlate output with network position.

## 2. 🤖 How We Built This: AI-First Engineering

This project demonstrates **AI-Augmented Development**.

I built this application using an **AI Pair Programmer**.

### The Workflow

1.  **Strategic Prompting**:
    *   I defined the *business problem* (HRBPs need to see the "Invisible Organization").
    *   I asked the AI to "think like an HRBP" to define the categories (Influence, Retention, Work Mode).

2.  **Rapid Prototyping (D3.js)**:
    *   I used the AI to generate the complex **D3.js** force-directed graph logic.
    *   *Key Command:* "Create a force-directed graph where node size equals centrality and color represents department."

3.  **Mock Data Generation**:
    *   To make the PoC realistic, I asked the AI to generate a "Story" in the data: *Create a scenario with an isolated 'Remote' cluster and a high-risk 'Key Influencer' named Sanne.*
    *   The AI generated the JSON structure that reflects this organizational tension.

4.  **Client-Side Privacy**:
    *   A key constraint was privacy. I instructed the AI to build a **Zero-Backend** solution. All data processing happens locally in the browser.

### Outcome
We moved from concept to a **functioning, interactive MVP** in less than 24 hours. This showcases how HR Tech leaders can use AI to rapidly prototype solutions.
