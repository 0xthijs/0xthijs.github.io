## What It Does
"The 1:1 Architect" is a productivity tool that helps employees prepare for bi-weekly manager meetings. It prompts users to input their raw thoughts and unstructured updates, then uses simple logic (and planned AI integration) to reformat them into a high-impact agenda.

## The Problem It Solves
Manager meetings often devolve into "status updates" or casual chats, leaving no time for meaningful career discussions. Employees struggle to articulate their wins or frame their blockers strategically.

## How It Works
Built on **Streamlit**, the app provides a guided workflow that forces the user to categorize their updates into "Strategic Wins," "Critical Blockers," and "Discussion Topics." It allows users to toggle between "Direct" and "Diplomatic" output modes to suit their manager's style.

## Key Features
- **Structured Agenda Generation**: Automatically formats inputs into a clear, readable briefing document.
- **Tone Calibration**: Offers "Direct" vs. "Diplomatic" phrasing options for sensitive topics.
- **Privacy-First**: Runs locally to ensure sensitive career discussions remain private.

## Results / Impact
Empowers employees to take ownership of their management relationship, shifting the focus from "what I did" to "what I achieved."
