Conventional wisdom suggests that promoting an employee locks them in. It's a reward, a recognition, and a golden handcuff.

**Data says otherwise.**

In my latest analysis of the IBM HR dataset, I tested the "Stagnation Hypothesis"—the idea that high performers leave because they aren't moving up fast enough. What I found was the opposite.

## The "Promotion Paradox"

I segmented high performers (Performance Rating $\ge$ 3) into two groups:
1.  **Stagnant:** No promotion in $> 2$ years.
2.  **Propelled:** Promoted within the last 2 years.

By calculating the attrition rate for each segment, I uncovered a critical insight:

### Key Metrics
*   **Stagnant High Performers:** 13.7% Attrition
*   **Propelled High Performers:** **17.0% Attrition**

## Why is this happening?

This phenomenon, often called the "Promotion Curse," likely stems from **Marketability vs. Loyalty**.

1.  **Title Shopping:** A new title makes a high performer significantly more attractive to external recruiters. They now have the "Senior" or "Lead" badge to validate their skills.
2.  **The "Valley of Despair":** The first year in a new role is stressful. Combined with the "I've arrived" mentality, this makes them susceptible to poaching.

## Strategic Recommendations

HR and Leadership must pivot from "Promote and Forget" to "Promote and Protect."

*   **Post-Promotion Onboarding:** Treat internal promotions like new hires. They need support, clear expectations, and a "re-recruitment" plan.
*   **Compensation Benchmarking:** Ensure the new salary is competitive *externally*, not just an incremental increase from their previous internal band.
