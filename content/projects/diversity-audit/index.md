Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) requires rigorous measurement. I conducted a full audit of our workforce data to answer two questions: **"Do we pay fairly?"** and **"Do we promote equitably?"**

## The Good News: Pay Equity

We calculated the **Adjusted Pay Gap**—comparing the average monthly income of men and women *within the same job level*.

The results are positive. The gap across all levels is **less than 2%**, and at Job Level 3, female employees actually earn slightly more on average. This indicates our compensation bands are working effectively to prevent systemic gender bias in pay.

## The Challenge: Leadership Representation

While pay is equal, *access* to higher-paying roles is not.

Our analysis shows a "leaky pipeline" to the C-Suite:
*   **Level 4 (Director):** 48% Female (Near Parity)
*   **Level 5 (Executive):** **34% Female**

## Conclusion & Next Steps
We have solved the "Equal Pay for Equal Work" equation. The next frontier is **"Equal Access to Work."**

HR Strategy will now focus on:
1.  **Sponsorship Programs:** Pairing Level 4 high-potential women with Executive sponsors.
2.  **Succession Planning:** Ensuring diverse slates for all Level 5 vacancies.
