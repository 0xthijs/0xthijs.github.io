## Executive Summary

This quarter, the HR Data Lab focused on **Retention Mechanics**. We analyzed the lifecycle of our high performers to answer one question: *Why do people leave?*

**The Answer:** It is not pay. It is **Transitions** and **Burnout**.

## 📌 Critical Risks identified

### 1. The "Promotion Curse" (Talent Risk)
We traditionally view promotions as a retention tool. Our data proves the opposite.
*   **Finding:** High Performers promoted in the last 2 years are **17.0%** likely to leave, vs **13.7%** for those who are stagnant.
*   **Rec:** Launch "Post-Promotion Onboarding" program immediately.

### 2. The "Red Zone" (Operational Risk)
We successfully built a predictive model for burnout using existing data fields (Overtime + Commute + Role).
*   **Finding:** 64 Employees are in the "High Risk" category with a **39.1%** attrition rate (4x the norm).
*   **Rec:** Immediate workload audit for these 64 individuals.

### 3. Diversity Health Check (Compliance)
*   **Status:** ✅ **Green**. Adjusted Pay Gap is negligible (<2%).
*   **Watchlist:** Executive representation (Level 5) remains low at 34%.
