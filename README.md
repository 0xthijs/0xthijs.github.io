# 🧠 Human-Centric Intelligence

![Human-Centric Intelligence](static/images/header.png)

> **Leveraging HR data for strategic decision-making — with AI as a co-pilot.**

I am a Senior HRBP developing AI-powered analytics tools to address critical business questions: *Why are high performers leaving? What are the indicators of burnout? is pay equitable across the organization?*

This repository serves as a portfolio of practical solutions — each project addresses a specific HR challenge, built using an AI-integrated workflow.
