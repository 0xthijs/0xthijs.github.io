# IBM HR Analytics: Attrition & Retention Strategies
**Project Status:** [In Progress]

## Project Overview
High employee attrition significantly impacts operational continuity and recruitment costs. This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to People Operations by analyzing IBM's attrition dataset.

**The Goal:** To identify key turnover drivers and provide actionable insights for strategic retention initiatives. This repository serves as a proof-of-concept for modern, evidence-based HR management.

## Key Objectives
1.  **Diagnostic:** Quantify the top 3 drivers of attrition using data analysis.
2.  **Hypothesis Testing:** Analyze the correlation between 'Distance from Home', 'Overtime', and 'Attrition'.
3.  **Optimization:** Create a salary benchmarking dashboard to identify compensation gaps per department.

## The Data
The dataset contains anonymized employee records (Source: IBM), including variables such as:
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Education Field
- **Engagement:** Job Satisfaction, Performance Rating, Work-Life Balance
- **History:** Years at Company, Years in Current Role, Years Since Last Promotion

## Technical Stack
- **Excel:** Advanced data cleaning, Pivot Tables, and logical functions (XLOOKUP).
- **SQL:** (Planned) For querying and segmenting large datasets.
- **PowerBI:** (Planned) For interactive dashboarding and stakeholder reporting.
