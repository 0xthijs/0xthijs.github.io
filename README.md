# AI-Augmented HR Portfolio & Data Lab

## Project Overview
This repository functions as a **Monorepo**, bridging the gap between a professional portfolio platform and an active data science laboratory. It represents the convergence of **People Logic** and **Machine Logic**.

## 1. The Platform
My personal website is built using **Hugo**, a fast and modern static site generator, and styled with the minimalist **PaperMod** theme.
- **Architecture**: Static Site Generator (Hugo)
- **Theme**: PaperMod (Fast, responsive, clean)
- **Deployment**: Hosted via GitHub Pages (Planned)

## 2. The Data Lab
Beyond the website, this repository houses raw datasets and analytical scripts used for my experiments in HR Analytics.
- **Data Sources**: Real-world and synthetic datasets (e.g., IBM HR Employee Attrition).
- **Tools**: SQL, Python, Power BI (Planned).
- **Goal**: To derive actionable insights for strategic HR decision-making.
